# Thoughts on DataFramed Ep. 318

Klaus Kleinfield, former CEO at Alcoa and Siemens, talked about how to avoid burnout, managing energy usage, and other things to help people focus. He first defines burnout, not as a lack of energy necessarily but rather as coming from not being able to manage energy usage properly. This opened my eyes for a moment. I always thought something was wrong with me, that when I needed to work on something I felt too tired. I would take naps to “gain energy” but that rarely did much, and consequently I would not be very productive. However, Kleinfield understands burnout as coming from being unable to manage energy. He further specifies types of energies: Emotional, Physical, Mental, and Spiritual. Emotional energy is something that must be controlled. Emotions are responses to outside stimuli, so being able to choose what emotions come out, training yourself to be emotionally stable, are necessary tools to have in order to manage emotional energy. Physical energy is simply making sure you are healthy. Eating healthy, exercising, and the like are all things that must be done to managing physical energy. Mental energy is what allows some to focus. Managing this comes from being able to know what to focus on and when to turn one side of your brain off so that the other side can work. Knowing when and how to take breaks is the key to managing this. Finally, spiritual energy is simply believing in a higher power, religion, etc. Kleinfield says that everyone should at least try out being religion to see if it helps you in any way. Though I generally disagree with the utilitarian approach, I do agree that belief in God is a comfort and foundation that one can use to build better habits and thoughts.

Kleinfield also emphasizes the importance of having a purpose for your work. He says purpose does to energy as a laser does to light, it focuses it and makes it more powerful. You need to get to a point where you can wake up in the morning and say, “I want to use this day to get this done!” I can attest to this greatly. As an aspiring writer, I often find myself stuck on tricky dialogue or plot points. However, when I find that answer, I cannot wait to write it and find ways to pull it off. I have often had days when I jump out of bed to complete it. Kleinfield adds that this is how you should feel about work. If you don’t like your work, find ways to change it, and if you cannot change it, leave it.
